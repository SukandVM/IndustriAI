Commit Title:
Completed Part 1: Data Collection and Integration

Commit Description:
In this commit, we collected and integrated data from three different sources:

    Social Media Sentiment: Collected data on customer sentiments based on their posts.
    Utility Payments: Integrated customer payment history for utilities.
    Geolocation Data: Included location stability scores based on customer city.

The datasets were cleaned by handling missing values and removing duplicates. These datasets were then merged into one final dataset and saved as final_merged_data.csv for further use.
